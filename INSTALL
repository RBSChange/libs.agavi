Archive Directory Structure:

- root
  - php_documentor (templates for generating Agavi API docs)
  - source (all source files)
    - agavi (the agavi source)
    - webapp (your web application, which should not be accessible from the web)
    - www (web accessible files)
  - samples (sample configuration files)


Installation Steps:

1. Move the "source/agavi" directory to a non web accessible location,
   preferrably the parent directory of your root web directory. On most
   installations this would be the parent directory of your "public_html" or
   "www" directory.

2. Move the "source/webapp" directory to a non web accessible location,
   preferrably the parent directory of your root web directory.

3. Give your "webapp/cache" directory full write permissions. In unix you can
   type "chmod 777 cache". On Windows you must go through your webserver to give
   it write permissions.

4. Move the "source/www/index.php" file to your web directory. This must be
   accessible from the web. Any location that is accessible via the web
   will do.

5. Configure your "webapp/config.php" configuration file.

6. Configure your web directory's "index.php" file that we just moved.

7. You're done. Try accessing your index.php file from the web.


Post-Install Configuration:

1. Setting up your database(s):

   Turn on database support in webapp/config/settings.ini. The USE_DATABASE
   setting is Off by default. Set it to On. Next, read the examples in
   webapp/config/databases.ini to setup your database connectivity.
